One of the primary ways we work towards our mission of growing technology education and talent in Utah is by sponsoring and running local meetups. Meetups are a great way to learn from local experts and also meet other great people in the area. 

## Forge Sponsored Meetups

The meetups we officially sponsor/own have chairs/co-chairs that are assigned to run the meetups, find speakers and venues, manage social media, and make sure food shows up! Our chairpeople get extra swag, limited edition badges/NFTs, and we are working on a small annual retreat! If you are intrested in being a Meetup Chair please email clint@theforge.tech.

# FAQ

#### I already run a meetup. Can Forge sponsor it?

We would love to take on as many meetups as our budget allows. Keep in mind, When Forge sponsors a meetup we take ownership of it (access to meetup page, social media, etc) and so we don't do it lightly. We want to make sure we have the resources to keep the meetup running for many years to come!
